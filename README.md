# Data Science @ UC Berkeley 
Repo containing programming projects from my undergraduate career at UC Berkeley.

## Contents

#### Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
- [Hog](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/hog):  In this project, I develop a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. I use control statements and higher-order functions together. In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the dice outcomes.

- [Ants](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/ants): In this project, I create a tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees. As the ant queen, I populate my colony with the bravest ants I can muster. My ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade our territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and thw queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies. This project combines functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. The project also involves understanding, extending, and testing a large program.

- [Scheme](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/scheme): In this project, I develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. As I proceed, I think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language; many quirks of languages are byproducts of implementation decisions in interpreters and compilers. The subset of the language used in this project is described in the functional programming section of Composing Programs. Since we only include a subset of the language, the interpreter will not exactly match the behavior of other interpreters. You will also implement some small programs in Scheme. Scheme is a simple but powerful functional language. You should find that much of what I have learned about Python transfers cleanly to Scheme as well as to other programming languages.

#### Artificial Intelligence: 
- [Search](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/search): In this project, my Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I will build general search algorithms and apply them to Pacman scenarios.

- [Multiagent](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/multiagent): In this project, I will design agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, I will implement both minimax and expectimax search and try my hand at evaluation function design.

- [Reinforcement](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/reinforcement): In this project, I will implement value iteration and Q-learning. I will test my agents first on Gridworld (from class), then apply them to a simulated robot controller (Crawler) and Pacman.

- [Tracking](https://github.com/sairachawla/data-science-berkeley/tree/main/tracking): In this project, I will design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. Iâ€™ll advance from locating single, stationary ghosts to hunting packs of multiple moving ghosts with ruthless efficiency.
